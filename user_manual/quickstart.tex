\chapter*{Quickstart}

By default, 

Congratulations! You're holding a brand-new picosafe in your hands! Picosafe is
a piece of hardware that provides you a secure platform.

This is a quickstart and we don't want to bore you, so let's start!

\section*{What to do first?}

Before you start, save your key and your bootloader!

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Save your key!
  
  Your key starts with \texttt{0x} followed by 32 more characters
  (\texttt{A}--\texttt{F}, \texttt{0}--\texttt{9}). The key is
  printed, so you have typewrite the 34 characters to a file.
  
  \item Save your bootloader!

  The bootloader is encrypted and an NDA forbids us to simply give you the tool
  that encrypts the bootloader. All we can do is give you the bootloader. The
  bootloader is saved in the folder \texttt{bootloader/}.
  
  The bootloader will simply boot the linux kernel on the first primary
  partition of the SD-card. The filename of the kernel must be
  \texttt{zImage.crypt} and it must be correct encrypted. You can encrypt your
  kernel yourself using the \texttt{picosafe-aes} tool. We promised to keep it
  short, so have a look at the user manual if you need further information.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{What does it?}

There is a key stored inside the processor that nobody can readout. When
powered, the processor will load the bootloader, decrypt it and start if the
bootloader if -- and only if -- it was encrypted with the correct key.  The
bootloader now loads a linux kernel from the SD-card, decrypts the kernel and
starts the kernel if -- and only if -- it was encrypted with the correct key.
Thus, if your linux kernel boots, you can be sure that nobody has altered your
kernel (chain of trust). If you are wondering how that works in detail, have a
look at the user manual!
