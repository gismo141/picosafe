Package: amanda-client
Description-md5: 21af3684379a64cacc51c39152ab1062
Description-en: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

 Lenses are the building blocks of the file <-> tree transformation; they
 combine parsing a file and building the tree (the get transformation), with
 turning the tree back into an (updated) file (the put transformation).
 .
 The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
 details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
 format and the transformation into a tree. This package includes the official
 set of lenses.

Description-md5: 618ecb2971ab1f6d5fd7213f2985ff5b
Description-en: conflict-driven nogood learning answer set solver
 clasp is an answer set solver for (extended) normal logic
 programs. It combines the high-level modeling capacities of answer
 set programming (ASP) with state-of-the-art techniques from the area
 of Boolean constraint solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on
 conflict-driven nogood learning, a technique that proved very
 successful for satisfiability checking (SAT). Unlike other learning
 ASP solvers, clasp does not rely on legacy software, such as a SAT
 solver or any other existing ASP solver. Rather, clasp has been
 genuinely developed for answer set solving based on conflict-driven
 nogood learning. clasp can be applied as an ASP solver (on LPARSE
 output format), as a SAT solver (on simplified DIMACS/CNF format), or
 as a PB solver (on OPB format).

Description-md5: 633246bd8fd1b951f15985f7cbfb1909
Description-en: global multiple nucleotide or peptide sequence alignment
 This program performs an alignment of multiple nucleotide or amino acid
 sequences. It recognizes the format of input sequences and whether the
 sequences are nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) or amino acid (proteins). The output
 format may be selected from in various formats for multiple alignments such as
 Phylip or FASTA. Clustal W is very well accepted.
 .
 The output of Clustal W can be edited manually but preferably with an
 alignment editor like SeaView or within its companion Clustal X. When building
 a model from your alignment, this can be applied for improved database
 searches. The Debian package hmmer creates such in form of an HMM.

Description-en: Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences (graphical interface)
 This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence
 alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing
 multiple sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results.
 The sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen.
 A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated to highlight conserved
 features in the alignment. For professional presentations, one should
 use the texshade LaTeX package or boxshade.
 .
 The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the
 options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
 You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment; you can
 select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a sub-range of the
 alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment.
 .
 An alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or
 exceptional residues can be highlighted.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: cvs
Description-md5: 62e6daa6a4968f3b8a09c5e8724afc0c
Description-en: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep access
 to old versions  of files (usually source code), keep a log of
 who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.
 It handles multiple developers, multiple directories, triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide
 area network. The texinfo manual provides further information on
 more tasks that it can perform.
 .
 There are some tasks that are not covered by CVS. They can be done in
 conjunction with CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and
 software other than CVS. These tasks are bug-tracking, build management
 (that is, make and make-like tools), and automated testing. However,
 CVS makes these tasks easier.

 Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python language as
 easy as Python itself. Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports
 more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.
 .
 The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
 additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables
 and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C
 code from Cython code.
 .
 This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping for external C libraries, and
 for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

Package: darktable
Description-md5: e032162292249abbe68076444d6959cc
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using libraw, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

Description-en: command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal
 drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for
 Drupal, a veritable Swiss Army knife designed to make life easier for
 Drupal power users who spend a lot of time hacking away at the
 command prompt.
 .
 Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code
 like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes
 sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear
 cache.

Package: drush-make
Description-md5: aa2a91cdd474caad23f2b4fd2f784213
Description-en: Drupal source code deployment tool
 Drush Make is an extension to drush that can create a ready-to-use
 Drupal code-base, pulling sources from various locations. It does this by
 parsing a flat text file (similar to a Drupal .info file) and
 downloading the sources it describes. In practical terms, this means
 that it is possible to distribute a complicated Drupal distribution as
 a single text file.
 .
 Among Drush Make's capabilities are:
 .
  * Downloading Drupal core, as well as contrib modules from
    drupal.org.
  * Checking code out from CVS, SVN, git, and bzr repositories.
  * Getting plain .tar.gz and .zip files (particularly useful for
    libraries that can not be distributed directly with Drupal core or
    modules).
  * Fetching and applying patches.
  * Fetching modules, themes, and installation profiles, but also
    external libraries.
  * Drush make does not turn modules on automatically: it only
    assembles Drupal directories -- it does not touch a database.

Package: duplicity
Description-md5: 4d1078d59b01217b0f9070c1c5c93a05
Description-en: encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup
 Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes
 and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity
 uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only
 record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup.
 Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they
 will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.

Package: dvcs-autosync
Description-md5: 93a8bbfb1921b78aec7c0e02d5ddcdd0
Description-en: Automatically synchronize distributed version control repositories
 dvcs-autosync is an open source replacement for Dropbox/Wuala/Box.net/etc.
 based on distributed version control systems (DVCS). It offers nearly
 instantaneous mutual updates when a file is added or changed on one side but
 with the added benefit of (local, distributed) versioning and that it does
 not rely on a centralized service provider, but can be used with any DVCS
 hosting option including a completely separate server.
 .
 Synchronization of directories is based on DVCS repositories. Git is used for
 main development and is being tested most thoroughly as the backend storage,
 but other DVCS such as Mercurial are also supported. dvcs-autosync is
 comparable to SparkleShare in terms of overall aim, but takes a more
 minimalistic approach. A single Python script monitors the configured
 directory for live changes, commits these changes to the DVCS (such as git)
 and synchronizes with other instances using XMPP messages.

Package: dwdiff
Description-md5: 9ba2eadca0b354a9f223010da4d2a070
Description-en: front-end for the diff program that operates word by word
 dwdiff is a front-end for the diff program that operates at the word level
 instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the
 user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that it takes an
 optional list of characters that should be considered delimiters. Delimiters
 are single characters that are treated as if they are words, even when there
 is no whitespace separating them from preceding words or delimiters. dwdiff
 is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff. Only the --autopager, --terminal
 and --avoid-wraps options are not supported.
 .
 The default output from dwdiff is the new text, with the deleted and inserted
 parts annotated with markers. Command line options are available to change
 both what is printed, and the markers.

Package: git-annex
Description-md5: 4923bf1ef95bb6363e854ab73673f6ba
Description-en: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
 git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
 contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
 dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
 to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
 .
 Even without file content tracking, being able to manage files with git,
 move files around and delete files with versioned directory trees, and use
 branches and distributed clones, are all very handy reasons to use git. And
 annexed files can co-exist in the same git repository with regularly
 versioned files, which is convenient for maintaining documents, Makefiles,
 etc that are associated with annexed files but that benefit from full
 revision control.

Package: gitolite
Description-md5: a2c2eed3b30135c8676c4f96d91073b5
Description-en: SSH-based gatekeeper for git repositories
 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that
 hosts many git repositories. Without gitolite,
 each developer needing to push to one of the repositories hosted would need a
 user account on that server; gitolite lets you do that just using
 SSH public keys tied to a single, common, user that hosts all the
 repositories.
 .
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write
 (push) to a repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an
 important issue in corporate environments. Other features include:
   * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory;
   * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes;
   * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation);
   * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split;
   * easy integration with gitweb;
   * comprehensive logging;
   * easy migration from gitosis.

 SpiderMonkey is a standalone JavaScript/ECMAScript interpreter. It can either
 take input from files or from a command line driven interface.
 It is not recommended for production use, as it contains dangerous
 (security-wise) debugging features.
 .
 ECMAScript (ECMA-262) is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype
 based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to
 both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn
 the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while
 loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as these
 languages (or nearly so).
 .
 JavaScript is a superset of the ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ECMAScript) standard
 first introduced by Netscape and now led by the Mozilla project.

Package: libjs-jquery-metadata
Description-md5: 82b6fad279b5aa5463b5e96d011768af
Description-en: jQuery plugin for parsing metadata from elements
 Sets the type of metadata to use. Metadata is encoded in JSON, and each
 property in the JSON will become a property of the element itself.
 .
 There are three supported types of metadata storage:
 .
   attr:  Inside an attribute. The name parameter indicates *which* attribute.
 .
   class: Inside the class attribute, wrapped in curly braces: { }
 .
   elem:  Inside a child element (e.g. a script tag). The name parameter
          indicates *which* element.
 .
 The metadata for an element is loaded the first time the element is accessed
 via jQuery.
 .
 As a result, you can define the metadata type, use $(expr) to load the metadata
 into the elements matched by expr, then redefine the metadata type and run
 another $(expr) for other elements.

Package: kbuild
Description-md5: a6a88ec57452f04f777c23642a30d83d
Description-en: framework for writing simple makefiles for complex tasks
 The goals of the kBuild framework:
  - Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
  - Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing ad-hoc
    solutions.
  - Makefile can very simple to write and maintain.
 .
 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
  - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
  - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
    simplification.
  - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
  - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well
 use the full GNU package.

 rpaf is for backend Apache servers what mod_proxy_add_forward is for
 frontend Apache servers. It does exactly the opposite of
 mod_proxy_add_forward written by Ask Bjorn Hansen.
 .
 It changes the remote address of the client visible to other Apache modules
 when two conditions are satisfied. First condition is that the remote client
 is actually a proxy that is defined in httpd.conf. Secondly if there is an
 incoming X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in its list of known
 proxies it takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and

Package: eatmydata
Description-md5: 8b35348223c5f515ecb4a88949a00006
Description-en: library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Package: libencode-hanextra-perl
Description-md5: c9657081f76f7811fdc359b8cf30270d
Description-en: perl module providing extra sets of Chinese character encodings
 Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese encodings,
 including the commonly used CP950, CP936 (also known as GBK),
 Big5 (alias for Big5-Eten), Big5-HKSCS, EUC-CN, HZ, and
 ISO-IR-165. However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering,
 and a complete coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution
 by several megabytes; hence, this module tries to provide the rest of them.
 If you are using Perl 5.8 or later, Encode::CN and Encode::TW will
 automatically load the extra encodings for you, so there's no need to
 explicitly write "use Encode::HanExtra" if you are using one of them
 already.

Package: libencode-locale-perl
Description-md5: 1c14f34a9b9d859825a55e14b46d6c7c
Description-en: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world is still byte
 based. Programs therefore needs to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arrange for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Package: libencode-perl
Description-md5: 6cc0080ebdddd83919780a1a5e291480
Description-en: module providing interfaces between Perl's strings and the system
 The Encode module provides the interfaces between Perl's strings and the
 rest of the system.
 .
 When Perl is processing "binary data", the programmer wants Perl to process
 "sequences of bytes". This is not a problem for Perl - as a byte has 256
 possible values, it easily fits in Perl's much larger "logical character".
 .
 Encodes a string from Perl's internal form into ENCODING and returns a
 sequence of octets.

 MouseX::Getopt is a role which provides an alternate constructor for creating
 objects using parameters passed in from the command line.
 .
 MouseX::Getopt attempts to DWIM as much as possible with the command line
 params by introspecting your class's attributes. It will use the name of your
 attribute as the command line option, and if there is a type constraint
 defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle the option accordingly.
 .
 You can use the trait MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait or the attribute
 metaclass MouseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute to get non-default commandline
 option names and aliases.

 .
 The main motivation for this module is to provide an easy way of preventing
 conflicts with your type names, since the internal fully qualified names of
 the types will be prefixed with the library's name. It also provides some
 convenient functions for working with Mouse types.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: f0d8ae5ba8e9f66ee137a1ae80d6b5c6
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.3.

Description-en: Metadata anonymisation toolkit
 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
 data that are being documented.
 .
 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
 .
 Mat only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.
 .
 If you really want to be anonym, use format that does not contain any
 metadata, or better: use plain-text.
 .
 Formats supported to some extent are:
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    - JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)
    - Open Document (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)
    - Office Openxml (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx, ...)

Description-en: Helper tools for including Maven metadata in Debian packages
 Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
 concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
 reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
 .
 Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete
 state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to
 attain this goal there are several areas of concern that Maven attempts
 to deal with:
 .
    * Making the build process easy
    * Providing a uniform build system
    * Providing quality project information
    * Providing guidelines for best practices development
    * Allowing transparent migration to new features
 .
 This package enables Debian packages which are not using Maven in their
 build process to provide and install Maven POMs and libraries in the
 repository located in /usr/share/maven-repo.
 .
 Packages built with Maven (using maven-debian-helper) will benefit as
 many of their dependencies are already packaged in Debian but they are
 missing the necessary metadata (Maven POM) which is required by Maven
 when it is using dependencies.

 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.
 .
 Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent
 hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,
 including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.

 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.
 .
 This package contains everything needed to build OCaml code targeted
 to be executed under windows.

 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and may be used as /bin/sh
 on Debian systems, in both /bin/mksh and /bin/mksh-static flavours.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against dietlibc
 (if dietlibc exists for that Debian architecture), and optimised for
 small code size, for example for use on initrd or initramfs images,
 installation or rescue systems, or /bin/sh on slow architectures.
 .

Description-en: build and execute command lines from standard input in parallel
 GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one
 or more machines. A job is typically a single command or a small
 script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The
 typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, or
 a list of tables.
 .
 If you use xargs today you will find GNU Parallel very easy to use. If
 you write loops in shell, you will find GNU Parallel may be able to
 replace most of the loops and make them run faster by running jobs in
 parallel. If you use ppss or pexec you will find GNU Parallel will
 often make the command easier to read.
 .
 GNU Parallel also makes sure output from the commands is the same
 output as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This
 makes it possible to use output from GNU Parallel as input for other
 programs.

    it to a Form XObject, suitable for use inside another PDF file
  * reportlab objects. pdfrw can recursively create a set of reportlab objects
    from its internal object format. This allows, for example, Form XObjects to
    be used inside reportlab.

 that pgpool-II is the actual PostgreSQL server, and the server (backend) sees
 pgpool-II as one of its clients. Because pgpool-II is transparent to both the
 server and the client, an existing database application can be used with
 pgpool-II almost without a change to its sources.

 database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables" the PostgreSQL server,
 allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for geographic information
 systems (GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS
 follows the OpenGIS "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This package contains the PostGIS userland binaries, common files and
 documentation.

Description-md5: ef3470a77fc6dee20bcbcc33637f1fb1
Description-en: Debian version number type for PostgreSQL
 Debian version numbers, used to version Debian binary and source
 packages, have a defined format, including specifications for how
 versions should be compared in order to sort them.  This package
 implements a "debversion" type to represent Debian version numbers
 within the PostgreSQL database.  This also includes operators for
 version comparison and index operator classes for creating indexes on
 the debversion type.
 .
 Version comparison uses the algorithm used by the Debian package
 manager, dpkg, using the implementation from libapt-pkg.  This means
 that columns in tables using the debversion type may be sorted and
 compared correctly using the same logic as "dpkg --compare-versions".
 It is also possible to create indexes on these columns.
 .
 postgresql-debversion implements the following features:
 .
  * The "debversion" type (internally derived from the "text" type)
  * A full set of operators for version comparison (< <= = <> >= >)
    including commutator and negator optimisation hints
  * Operator classes for btree and hash indexes
  * The aggregate functions min() and max()

Package: python-psycopg2
Description-md5: f9adffa6f96ecc5db24e2fecca0cad2c
Description-en: Python module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asycronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.

Description-en: B-tree library for Python
 An implementation of a particular kind of B-tree, based on research
 by Ohad Rodeh. This is the same data structure that btrfs uses, but
 in a new, pure-Python implementation.
 .
 The distinctive feature of this B-tree is that a node is never (conceptually)
 modified. Instead, all updates are done by copy-on-write. This makes it
 easy to clone a tree, and modify only the clone, while other processes
 access the original tree.
 .
 The implementation is generic and flexible, so that you may use it in
 a variety of situations. For example, the tree itself does not decide
 where its nodes are stored: you provide a class that does that for it.
 The library contains two implementations, one for in-memory and one
 for on-disk storage.

Package: buildd
Description-md5: 8cc8847a1a7d3580faaf822122f7dcd9
Description-en: Daemon for automatically building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are
 used to build binary packages from source packages.  The wanna-build
 database tracks packages which require building; buildd schedules
 work from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild
 does the actual package building.
 .
 buildd is a daemon which will build Debian packages automatically
 using the wanna-build database to identify which packages need to be
 built.  Note that the wanna-build database is not packaged, and
 requires installing separately.

 .
 This package contains the core library modules used by these
 programs.

Package: sbuild
Description-md5: 61eb4b5598974ea784e54401eed36b58
Description-en: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are used to build
 binary packages from source packages.  sbuild does the actual package
 building.
 .
 sbuild uses chroots to build packages, which act as virtual, minimal
 operating system installations dedicated to package building.  This
 means that a number of environments may be used for building
 simultaneously on the same machines, for example stable, testing,
 unstable and experimental.  When coupled with schroot to create
 snapshots of chroots, sbuild may be used to build many packages in
 parallel.  A chroot envionment allows packages to be built in a
 controlled, clean environment.  sbuild installs only essential and
 build-essential packages, plus those in the package build
 dependencies.

Package: dchroot
Description-md5: 1c3c5fa410a563eef041e2880c4a90e8
Description-en: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 dchroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as
 necessary.
 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of
 dchroot.  In particular:
  * dchroot quoting issues are not present.  dchroot runs commands in
    the chroot with -c option of the user's default shell; when
    multiple command options are used, the options are concatenated
    together, separated by spaces.  This concatenation breaks shell
    quoting.
  * schroot implements fine-grained access controls based on users
    and groups, either of which may be granted the ability to gain
    root access to the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide additional
 functionality dchroot does not possess.

Package: dchroot-dsa
Description-md5: 3a7f7964560f050bd706f13e66ab96d9
Description-en: Execute commands in a chroot environment
 dchroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  A typical installation might provide 'stable',
 'testing' and 'unstable' chroots.  Users can move between chroots as
 necessary.
 .
 This package provides a dchroot-dsa binary which is compatible with
 the command-line options and configuration file format used by the
 dchroot-dsa dchroot maintained by the Debian System Administrators
 used on machines administered for the Debian Project.
 .
 NOTE: the schroot package provides a better implementation of
 dchroot-dsa.  In particular:
  * dchroot-dsa only allows the specification of a single command with
    an absolute path, and no options may be used with the command;
    schroot allows the use of relative and absolute paths with no
    limit on the number of options.
  * dchroot-dsa only allows one chroot to be used at once; schroot will
    allow the use of as many chroots as desired.
  * dchroot-dsa allows access to be restricted to named users; schroot
    implements finer-grained access controls based on users and groups,
    either of which may be granted the ability to gain root access to
    the chroot if required.
 Using schroot will avoid these issues, as well as provide significant
 additional functionality dchroot-dsa does not possess.

Description-en: development files for the Debian source builder
 sbuild provides facilities to manage and access chroots, as part of
 schroot.
 .
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be created, and
 access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
 users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  Additionally, schroot can
 switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM for
 authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged for
 security.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 develop applications which make use of sbuild.  Once the API and ABI
 are stable, a shared library will replace the static library.

 .
 Several different types of chroot are supported, including normal
 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files (tar with optional
 compression) and Btrfs and LVM snapshots are also supported.
 .
 schroot supports kernel personalities, allowing the programs run
 inside the chroot to have a different personality.  For example,
 running 32-bit chroots on 64-bit systems, or even running binaries
 from alternative operating systems such as SVR4 or Xenix.
 .
 schroot also integrates with sbuild, to allow building packages with
 all supported chroot types, including session-managed chroot types
 such as Btrfs and LVM snapshots.
 .
 schroot shares most of its options with dchroot, but offers vastly
 more functionality.

 be placed onto a server which is connected to the Internet around-the-clock;
 one or more frontends then connect to the core. This way, the connection to
 IRC can be kept up even when all frontends have been closed. The combination
 of screen and irssi served as example for this architecture.

 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Package: syncmaildir
Description-md5: b351b723bcdb6875a853e251774b308b
Description-en: Sync Mail Dir is a set of tools to synchronize Maildirs
 Sync Mail Dir is a set of utilities to synchronize a pair of mail boxes
 in Maildir format, using SSH to transfer data. It provides the smd-pull
 utility to pull changes made on the remote mailbox, smd-push to propagate
 local changes to the remote mailbox, smd-loop to iterate push and pull
 in a timely way.
 .
 The software is young and should thus be used with care in production
 environments.
 .
 Unlike OfflineIMAP It requires no IMAP server to be installed on the remote
 host. Moreover it never attempts to automatically resolve conflicts between
 incompatible mailbox statuses, it just notifies the user explaining how
 he can fix the problem.
 .
 Sync Mail Dir design is similar to the one of Maildirsync, but is more
 efficient in terms of CPU cycles and disk I/O.

Package: tor
Description-md5: f02134718b7fbd2f0a50f28ece508e3f
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system which
 addresses many flaws in the original onion routing design.
 .
 In brief, Onion Routing is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication
 service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down
 the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals
 the downstream node.
 .
 Basically Tor provides a distributed network of servers ("onion
 routers"). Users bounce their tcp streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc)
 around the routers, and recipients, observers, and even the routers
 themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning.  That means there is a danger that
 application protocols and associated programs can be induced to reveal
 information about the initiator.  Tor depends on Privoxy and similar protocol
 cleaners to solve this problem.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 onion proxy.  If the application itself does not come with socks support
 you can use a socks client such as tsocks.  Some web browsers like mozilla
 and web proxies like privoxy come with socks support, so you don't need an
 extra socks client if you want to use Tor with them.
 .
 This package enables only the onion proxy by default, but it can be configured
 as a relay (server) node.
 .
 Remember that this is development code -- don't rely on the current Tor
 network if you really need strong anonymity.
 .

Description-en: Collection of video4linux support libraries (32 bits development files)
 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixelformat
 to BGR24, RGB24, YUV420 and YVU420.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).

Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: ff95e4399e5ec034de6998347673eb73
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
