Package: glx-alternative-fglrx
Description-md5: e8f7c11cb884cb4b9667693d4083bb72
Description-en: allows the selection of FGLRX as GLX provider
 In setups with several GLX providers (e.g. the free MESA implementation and
 proprietary graphics hardware vendor implementations) this metapackage
 allows one to switch to the non-free FGLRX driver and libraries.
 .
 Use 'update-alternatives --config glx' to select an implementation.

 This package does not depend on the corresponding FGLRX libraries.
 In order to install the FGLRX driver and libraries, install the fglrx-glx and
 fglrx-driver packages instead.

Description-en: allows the selection of MESA as GLX provider
 In setups with several GLX providers (e.g. the free MESA implementation and
 proprietary graphics hardware vendor implementations) this metapackage
 allows one to switch back to MESA.
 .
 Use 'update-alternatives --config glx' to select an implementation.
 .
 This package does not depend on the corresponding MESA libraries.
 In order to install the MESA libraries, install the libgl1-mesa-glx package
 instead.

Package: glx-alternative-nvidia
Description-md5: c8e0945c94cff0337243877a93f0aadd
Description-en: allows the selection of NVIDIA as GLX provider
 In setups with several GLX providers (e.g. the free MESA implementation and

 Use 'update-alternatives --config glx' to select an implementation.
 .
 This package does not depend on the corresponding NVIDIA libraries.
 In order to install the NVIDIA driver and libraries, install the nvidia-glx
 package instead.

Package: glx-diversions
Description-md5: 11d73a2c74770f5f3371f8803595735d
Description-en: prepare for using accelerated GLX implementations from GPU vendors
 Diverts the free libGL.so implementation (MESA) and the xserver module

Package: iucode-tool
Description-md5: 85b8e9a4d04e1dafc3c5baa7e46a23a4
Description-en: Intel processor microcode tool
 iucode_tool is a program to manipulate IntelÂ® X86 and X86-64 processor
 microcode collections, and to use the kernel facilities to upgrade the
 microcode on Intel system processors.
 .
 It can load microcode data files in text and binary format, sort, list and
 filter the microcodes contained in these files, write selected microcodes to a
 new file in binary format, or upload them to the kernel.
 .
 It operates on non-free microcode data downloaded directly from Intel or
 installed by the intel-microcode package.

Description-md5: 71c9cd04112d6cef6a0d35dd8ec66dd8
Description-en: NV-CONTROL X extension (development files)
 The NV-CONTROL X extension provides a mechanism for X clients to
 query and set configuration parameters of the NVIDIA X driver.
 State set by the NV-CONTROL X extension is assumed to be persistent
 only for the current server generation.

Package: libxnvctrl0
Description-md5: 6d4f8aebac836277193a58e922a49603
Description-en: NV-CONTROL X extension (runtime library)
 The NV-CONTROL X extension provides a mechanism for X clients to
 query and set configuration parameters of the NVIDIA X driver.
 State set by the NV-CONTROL X extension is assumed to be persistent
 only for the current server generation.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Package: nvidia-settings
Description-md5: 9bb7c34dc84550e6fff415c0eb0eda37
Description-en: Tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver
 The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA
 Linux graphics driver.  It operates by communicating with the NVIDIA
 X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This
 communication is done with the NV-CONTROL X extension.
 .
 Values such as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature,
 and OpenGL settings can be queried and configured via nvidia-settings.

Package: nvidia-installer-cleanup
Description-md5: 847b89702ca18a017e02c9f8ef70ed6c
Description-en: Cleanup after driver installation with the nvidia-installer
 This package takes care that no old installation of the non-free NVIDIA
 graphics drivers that was done with the nvidia-installer remains on the
 system.  Such an installation conflicts with the packaged drivers.
 .
 Furthermore using the nvidia-installer to install a new version of the
 drivers is prevented as long as this package is installed.

Package: nvidia-kernel-common
