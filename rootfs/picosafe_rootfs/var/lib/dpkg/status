Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).

 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It also makes fonts managed by defoma

Description: The GNU Parted disk partitioning shared library
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 This package contains libparted, the required shared library
 used by Parted.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: simple interprocess messaging system
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: ISC DHCP server (transitional package)
 This is the client from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of
 DHCP. For more information visit http://www.isc.org.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 This is a dummy package to aid in transitioning from the v3 DHCP packages
 to the new-style DHCP packages.
 .
 This dummy package may be safely removed after upgrading to squeeze

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav6, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 This package provides the /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5 CGI interpreter built
 for use in Apache 2 with mod_actions, or any other CGI httpd that
 supports a similar mechanism.  Note that MOST Apache users probably
 want the libapache2-mod-php5 package.
 The following extensions are built in: bcmath bz2 calendar Core ctype date
  dba dom ereg exif fileinfo filter ftp gettext hash iconv json libxml
  mbstring mhash openssl pcre Phar posix Reflection session shmop SimpleXML
  soap sockets SPL standard sysvmsg sysvsem sysvshm tokenizer wddx xml
  xmlreader xmlwriter zip zlib.
 .
 PHP5 is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
 especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
 The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly. This version of PHP5 was built
 with the Suhosin patch.

 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
 removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the
 default package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: The Linux Kernel Device Mapper userspace library
 The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)
 Team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
 volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
 in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS, software
 raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
 .
 This package contains the (user-space) shared library for accessing the
 device-mapper; it allows usage of the device-mapper through a clean,
 consistent interface (as opposed to through kernel ioctls).

  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http(s) and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites -- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Cyrus SASL - authentication abstraction library
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.1.
 .
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. If you intend to
 use this package on a server that provides SASL authentication, then
 you must install some of the libsasl2-modules* packages.

Description: UPnP IGD client lightweight library
 The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft
 Windows 2K/XP. The aim of the MiniUPnP project is to bring a free software
 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular.
 .
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.

Description: Tool to organize boot sequence using LSB init.d script dependencies
 The insserv program is used to update the order of symlinks in
 /etc/rc?.d/ with sysv-rc based on dependencies specified in the
 scripts themselves using LSB init.d script headers.
 .
 This allow each package maintainer to specify their init.d script
 relation to other scripts and make it possible to detect and reject
 script dependency loops as well as making sure all scripts start in
 their intended order.
 .
 The program insserv in this package should be used with care and
 together with the sysv-rc package, as using it incorrectly can lead
 to an unbootable system.

 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also

 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Description: configures encrypted block devices
 Cryptsetup provides a command-line interface for configuring encrypted
 devices. This is done using the Linux kernel device mapper target
 dm-crypt. This version of cryptsetup has integrated support for LUKS.
 .
 cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
 but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
 automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
 file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
 initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.

Description: Apache HTTP Server common files
 The Apache Software Foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and
 extensible HTTP server as standards-compliant open source software. The
 result has long been the number one web server on the Internet.
 .
 This package contains the configuration and support scripts.
 However, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to
 install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages, such as worker or prefork.

 This package provides the /usr/bin/php5 command interpreter, useful for
 testing PHP scripts from a shell or performing general shell scripting tasks.
 The following extensions are built in: bcmath bz2 calendar Core ctype date
  dba dom ereg exif fileinfo filter ftp gettext hash iconv json libxml
  mbstring mhash openssl pcntl pcre Phar posix Reflection session shmop
  SimpleXML soap sockets SPL standard sysvmsg sysvsem sysvshm tokenizer wddx
  xml xmlreader xmlwriter zip zlib.
 .
 PHP5 is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
 especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.
 The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write
 dynamically generated pages quickly. This version of PHP5 was built
 with the Suhosin patch.

Description: PHP PEAR Database Abstraction Layer
 DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
  * an OO-style query API
  * portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work
    with other DBMS's
  * a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
  * prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it
    natively
  * a result object for each query response
  * portable error codes
  * sequence emulation
  * sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
  * formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or objects
  * row limit support
  * transactions support
  * table information interface
  * DocBook and phpDocumentor API documentation
 .
 DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing database extensions.
 .
 Drivers for the following extensions pass the complete test suite and
 provide interchangeability when all of the database's portability
 options are enabled:
  fbsql, ibase, informix, msql, mssql,
  mysql, mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql,
  sqlite and sybase.
 .
 There is also a driver for the dbase extension, but it can't be used
 interchangeably because dbase doesn't  support many standard DBMS
 features.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do some basic daily system
 maintenance tasks, such as creating backups of key system files. Other
 packages, such as checksecurity, can provide further maintenance tasks.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is recommended as it will prevent
 /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 Defoma, which stands for DEbian FOnt MAnager, provides a framework
 for automatic font configuration. An application whose configuration
 of fonts usually requires manual intervention can automate the
 process through Defoma, by installing a Defoma-configuration
 script. The script gets called whenever a font is installed and
 removed, so that the script may update the application configuration.
 .
 Font packages should register their fonts to Defoma in order to have them
 configured automatically for applications.

Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Description: ISC DHCP client
 This is the client from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of
 DHCP. For more information visit http://www.isc.org.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.
 .
 Extra documentation can be found in the package isc-dhcp-common.

Description: A system call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

 LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
 Grammars (PEGs). PEGs look similar to regular expressions or context-free
 grammars in Backus-Naur form (BNF) notation. PEGs make a good replacement for
 regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. For example, a
 regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
 it is not recursive, but a PEG can.
