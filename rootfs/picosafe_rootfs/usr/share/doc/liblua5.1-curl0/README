Lua-cURL

These are libcURL bindings for lua 5.0 and lua 5.1, the ones used in FreePOPs
(see http://www.freepops.org). The newest version of the package can be found
at:

http://luaforge.net/projects/luacurl/

Note that the source package is the one with the -freepops suffix (since two
implementations exists). They should compile cleanly using curl from version
7.9.5 to 7.11.2. It is tested against 7.15.4 and should compile with newer
versions too, but no flags newer that 7.11.2 are bound. Only the libcURL easy
interface is bound. See the first lines of the Makefile for some compilation
flags. The following variables can be overridden:

 LIBNAME=liblua-curl
 LIBTOOL=libtool --silent --tag=CC
 HEADER=/usr/include/curl/curl.h
 PREFIX=/usr/local/
 LUA=lua5.1 # use lua50 to compile for lua 5.0
 LUADOC= luadoc

5.0 and lua 5.1) at your option. No warranties.

The documentation in doc/curl.html contains some examples too.
