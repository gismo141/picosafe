Package: libxrender-dev
Version: 1:0.9.7-r0
Description: XRender: X Rendering Extension library - Development files
 The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition
 as the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation
 into either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs
 into the server and rendering sets of them.  This package contains
 symbolic links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
