Package: gettext-dev
Version: 0.18.1.1-r11
Description: Utilities and libraries for producing multi-lingual messages. - Development files
 Gettext offers to programmers, translators, and even users, a well
 integrated set of tools and documentation. Specifically, the GNU
 `gettext' utilities are a set of tools that provides a framework to help
 other GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a
 set of conventions about how programs should be written to support
 message catalogs, a directory and file naming organization for the
 message catalogs themselves, a runtime library supporting the retrieval
 of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to massage in
 various ways the sets of translatable strings, or already translated
 strings.  This package contains symbolic links, header files, and related
 items necessary for software development.
